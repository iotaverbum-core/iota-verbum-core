This Software Services Agreement (the "Agreement") is entered into as of January 15, 2024 (the "Effective Date"), by and between Larkspur Analytics LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("Larkspur" or "Licensor"), and Northwind Devices Ltd., an Oregon corporation ("Northwind" or "Licensee"). Larkspur Analytics LLC as licensor and Northwind Devices Ltd. as licensee agree that the terms below govern the subscription, support, and use of the Software.

1. Definitions. "Software" means the hosted workflow orchestration platform described in Schedule A. "Confidential Information" means any non-public business, technical, financial, or operational information disclosed by either party in any form. "Service Data" means the operational records, usage logs, support tickets, and configuration details generated through Licensee's use of the Software. The implementation plan attached as Schedule B (the "Implementation Plan") is incorporated into this Agreement for operational milestones.

2. Term. The term of this Agreement will begin on the Effective Date and continue until January 14, 2025 for one (1) year, unless earlier terminated in accordance with this Agreement. Upon mutual written agreement, the parties may renew this Agreement for additional one-year periods.

3. License Grant and Access. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Licensor grants Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access and use the Software during the Term for Licensee's internal business operations. Licensee shall restrict access to the Software to its employees and contractors who have a need to use the Software for authorized business purposes. Licensee must maintain current administrative contact information and shall promptly notify Licensor of any unauthorized access, suspected credential compromise, or misuse of the Software.

4. Implementation and Support. Licensor shall configure the Software in accordance with the Implementation Plan within thirty (30) days after the Effective Date. Licensor shall provide remote onboarding sessions, administrator training materials, and standard email support during Licensor's normal business hours. Licensee agrees to provide timely access to personnel, systems, and information reasonably required for configuration, testing, and deployment. Licensee will designate a project manager who is authorized to approve milestones, coordinate user acceptance testing, and consolidate implementation feedback.

5. Fees and Payment. Licensee shall pay the subscription fees set forth in Schedule C within fifteen (15) days after receipt of an undisputed invoice. If Licensee disputes any invoice in good faith, Licensee must give Licensor written notice describing the disputed amount and the basis for the dispute before the payment due date. Undisputed amounts that remain unpaid after the due date will accrue interest at the lesser of one percent (1.0%) per month or the maximum rate permitted by law.

6. Confidentiality. Each party shall use the other party's Confidential Information solely to perform or receive benefits under this Agreement and shall protect that Confidential Information using at least reasonable care. Neither party shall disclose the other party's Confidential Information to any third party except to employees, contractors, or professional advisers who are bound by obligations of confidentiality no less protective than those in this Agreement. Licensee must not remove or obscure any proprietary notice embedded in the Software, documentation, or training materials.

7. Data Handling. Licensor shall process Service Data only for the purpose of providing, maintaining, securing, and improving the Software as permitted by this Agreement. Licensor must maintain administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect Service Data against unauthorized access, loss, or disclosure. Licensee shall remain responsible for the accuracy, quality, and legality of all Service Data submitted to the Software.

8. Termination. Either party may terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days written notice if the other party materially breaches this Agreement and fails to cure that breach within the notice period. Licensor may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice if Licensee intentionally misuses the Software, repeatedly violates the use restrictions, or becomes insolvent. Upon termination, Licensee shall cease all use of the Software, and Licensor shall make Service Data available for export for thirty (30) days after the effective date of termination.

9. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware. The state and federal courts located in Wilmington, Delaware will have exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement.
